# Waterloo Adjustment Factors

**Please update this if newer adjustment factors are available.**

This repository contains the adjustment factors from 2008-2024, used for the 2008/09-2024/25 admissions cycles. The adjustment factors are used for Engineering admissions at Waterloo only.

## Where are the latest adjustment factors?
This is the latest data as of the 2024-2025 admission cycle. To acquire future data for future admission cycles, 
someone would have to make a [FIPPA request](https://uwaterloo.ca/privacy/access-request) to Waterloo to request the data (Cost: 5 dollars and a lot of waiting on email). Feel free to make a pull request to add future admission cycles to this repo.
