# Waterloo Adjustment Factors

**A FIPPA request for the 2023 and 2024 adjustment factors (2023/24 and 2024/25 admission cycles) has been made. A response is expected by March 2025.**

This repository contains the adjustment factors from 2016-2022, used for the 2016/17-2022/23 admissions cycles. The adjustment factors are used for Engineering admissions at Waterloo only.

## Where are the latest adjustment factors?
I do not have the 2023 adjustment factors, used for the 2023/24 admission cycle. To acquire this data, 
someone (me, in 2022) would have to make a [FIPPA request](https://uwaterloo.ca/privacy/access-request) to Waterloo to request the data. I did not make this request this year, and if you or someone you know has made the request
and has obtained data, feel free to make a pull request to add it to this repo.
